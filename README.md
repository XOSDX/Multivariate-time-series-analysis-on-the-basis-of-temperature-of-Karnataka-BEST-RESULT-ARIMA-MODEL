Introduction
In the context of analyzing temperature data for Karnataka, various statistical and machine learning models were applied to determine the most accurate forecasting method. This study employed multiple regression and forecasting techniques including Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, ANN ensemble learning, and ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average). After extensive testing and evaluation, ARIMA emerged as the superior model. This report details why ARIMA outperformed the other models and the limitations observed in the alternatives.

ARIMA Model Superiority
ARIMA was selected as the best model for predicting temperature variations in Karnataka due to several key factors:

Handling Both Linear and Non-linear Trends: ARIMA's capability to model both linear and non-linear trends makes it highly suitable for capturing the complex temporal patterns in temperature data. This flexibility is crucial for climate analysis, where both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends must be accurately depicted.

Precision in Forecasting: The ARIMA model provided temperature predictions that closely matched the actual observed data. The forecasts were in the range of 25 to 27 degrees Celsius, which is very close to the recorded climate data for Karnataka, demonstrating high precision and reliability.

Time Series Stationarity: ARIMA is designed to work well with time series data by ensuring stationarity through differencing. This characteristic makes it adept at handling the seasonal and cyclical nature of temperature data, which is essential for accurate climate modeling.


Limitations of Other Models


ANN Ensemble Learning:

Complexity Handling: While ANN ensemble learning methods have the potential to capture highly complex patterns, they fell short in this specific case. The forecasted temperatures ranged widely from -15.0 to 15.3 degrees Celsius, indicating a lack of precision.
Overfitting and Underfitting: The model struggled with overfitting to the training data and underfitting to the test data, resulting in poor generalization and unreliable forecasts.

Lasso and Ridge Regression:

Minimal Gain over Linear Regression: Both Lasso and Ridge Regression showed performance similar to Linear Regression, suggesting minimal improvement in capturing non-linear changes in temperature data.
Inadequate Non-linearity Capture: These regression techniques did not adequately capture the non-linear aspects of the temperature data, leading to less accurate predictions compared to ARIMA.
Linear Regression:

Simplistic Approach: Linear Regression, being a straightforward method, failed to account for the intricate seasonal and trend components inherent in the temperature data. This limitation resulted in less accurate and less reliable forecasts compared to the ARIMA model.
Detailed Analysis and Results
The evaluation involved fitting each model to historical temperature data from Karnataka, preprocessing the data to handle missing values, and ensuring stationarity. Various statistical tools such as autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions were used to identify the appropriate parameters for the ARIMA model.

The ARIMA model's predictions were validated by examining the residual errors to ensure that the model fit well and provided accurate forecasts. Additionally, a comparison of real temperatures with model predictions and future forecasts was conducted to assess the model's performance.

The ARIMA model stood out as the most effective tool for forecasting temperature variations in Karnataka due to its ability to handle complex temporal patterns, ensure precision, and model both linear and non-linear trends effectively. In contrast, ANN ensemble learning and regression models like Lasso and Ridge Regression failed to match ARIMA's accuracy and reliability. Therefore, for climate researchers and policymakers aiming to develop strategies for climate adaptation and resilience in Karnataka, ARIMA provides a robust and dependable forecasting method.

## **Multivariate Time Series Analysis based on Temperature of Karnataka**
This project involves a multivariate time series analysis focused on the temperature of Karnataka. It explores various predictive models, including Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and ARIMA. The ARIMA model is found to be the best-performing model for this task.

Project Overview
This project aims to analyze temperature data from Karnataka and build predictive models using different techniques to forecast future temperatures. This analysis is essential for understanding climate patterns and preparing for potential climate change impacts. After testing multiple models, the ARIMA model provided the most accurate results.

Data
The dataset used for this project includes historical temperature records from various regions in Karnataka. The data is multivariate, comprising several features like:

Average temperature
Minimum temperature
Maximum temperature
Humidity
Wind speed
Rainfall
Models Used
The following models were applied and evaluated:

Linear Regression
Lasso Regression
Ridge Regression
Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
Best Model: ARIMA
The ARIMA model was the best-performing model in this analysis, producing results with an error range of 25 to 27. ARIMA is particularly effective for time series forecasting, as it considers autocorrelations and other time-based dependencies in the data.

Order of ARIMA: (p, d, q) parameters were selected based on extensive testing and evaluation.
Performance: ARIMA provided the closest results to the actual temperature values compared to other models.

Why Did ARIMA Work Best?
Handling of Temporal Dependencies: ARIMA models the relationships between past values and future predictions, which is crucial in time series data.
Minimal Overfitting: Other models like ANN had issues with overfitting, leading to incorrect temperature forecasts, including unrealistic values (e.g., -15.0째C to 15.3째C).

Results
ARIMA: Produced the most accurate temperature predictions, with errors ranging from 25 to 27.
ANN: Failed to deliver realistic results, showing values from -15.0째C to 15.3째C.
Lasso & Ridge Regression: Delivered results similar to Linear Regression but were not sufficiently accurate.

Usage


To run the project:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/username/Multivariate-time-series-analysis-on-the-basis-of-temperature-of-Karnataka.git
cd Multivariate-time-series-analysis-on-the-basis-of-temperature-of-Karnataka
Preprocess the data:

Load the dataset and preprocess it for analysis. Ensure data is cleaned and normalized if necessary.
Train the models:

Train Linear, Lasso, Ridge, ANN, and ARIMA models. Compare the results using evaluation metrics like RMSE and MAE.
View results:

Evaluate the models and visualize the predictions against the actual temperature values. Use the ARIMA model for best results.
Forecast future temperatures:

Once the ARIMA model is trained, it can be used to forecast future temperatures based on the given historical data.

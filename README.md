Introduction
In the context of analyzing temperature data for Karnataka, various statistical and machine learning models were applied to determine the most accurate forecasting method. This study employed multiple regression and forecasting techniques including Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, ANN ensemble learning, and ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average). After extensive testing and evaluation, ARIMA emerged as the superior model. This report details why ARIMA outperformed the other models and the limitations observed in the alternatives.

The ANN python notebook consists of the computation performed using the ANN architecture concept which did not yield the results correctly as per prediction it has to because of the negative values of temperatures obtained from it.

The Linear Regression model python notebook demonstrates that even Linear Regression along with its slightly higher versions of Lasso and Ridge Regressions also failed to show the correct results because it led to output visualization that was chaotic and had unnecessary intersection points confusing and made it hard to distinguish the scenarios occurred in different years.

The ARIMA Model python notebook led to the best possible results as the desired outcomes for the values of temperature of Karnataka and therefore suited over any other models for this given task as well as gave easier to understand and eye-catching visualizations.

The three of the above notebooks uploaded give us an idea to distinguish which model is the best depending upon how they compute the given data, work on it, and then analyze in a structured way in which they generate the outputs differing from each other.

This study involves a multivariate time series 
analysis mainly based on temperature data from Karnataka, 
India. Using advanced statistical machine learning techniques, 
we examine the temporal trends, seasonal trends, and potential 
relationships in the temperature dataset Our findings reveal 
small-scale temperature variations in Karnataka, and provide 
insights which is valuable for meteorological studies and local 
climate change assessments. This review highlights the 
importance of temperature-focused research in understanding 
local climate change and identifies targeted strategies for 
climate resilience and adaptation in Karnataka. Arima model to 
be selected for best possible outcomes.
